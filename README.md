# Work-Day-Scheduler
I created a simple calender that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
When the user opens the calender, the current date is displayed (day of week, month, day, and year), as well as the current time and time zone.
The user is presented with timeblocks for that day, where they can input tasks for each hour listed.
The data the user inputs into the task field in the timeblock is saved to local storage.
The timeblocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, future.
